Service to add/del ts3 users to/from server groups.

## why?

```
users want to fully communicate with others in ts3
server admins want to grant access to users by adding them to server groups
server admins want to remove invalid users from all groups
they all want it in fast and automatic manner
decision about to which group users should be added or when they should be removed
  is based on information about their eve characters
```

## how?

```
service receives a http request from user to create a time limited registration record
the request contains a cookie with information about user's eve character(name, id, 
  corporation ticker, alliance ticker)
user connects to a ts3 server and is automatically added to a proper server group
service periodically contacts validation server and removes from server groups those users
  who are marked as invalid by validation server
```

## notes

This service is a part of bundle of other services and is supposed to be run behind and contacted only by [https://github.com/prusya/eve-auth-gateway-service](https://github.com/prusya/eve-auth-gateway-service)

This service does not provide mechanisms to restrict connections to it and it's up to end user to limit who can connect to it. Suggested solution is to use a firewall to allow connections only from `eve-auth-gateway-service` host
